# ACf Dynamic AJAX Select Example

This repo is an example of how to dynamically load an ACF select field based on the selection made in
another ACF select field. This example can be used as the basis of understanding how to extend ACF to
use AJAX for the creation of dyanmic fields. Every field type in ACF will need slightly different code
to get this to work. This is presented in the hope that it will help others to better understand how
to extend the functionality of ACF.

See the comments in the files for comments about the code and what it is doing.
