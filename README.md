# ACf Dynamic AJAX Field Examples

***These examples only works in ACF5***

This repo contains several examples of using AJAX to dynamically load fields based on the values
in other fields. See the individual example folders for more information.

There are also some other examples here that are more complicated than what can be found in my
[ACF Filters & Functions Repo](https://github.com/Hube2/acf-filters-and-functions) becuase each
of these examples requires code in several files.

The following is a brief explanation of each example

**dynamic-select-example:** Load values into a select field based on a choice made in another select field

**dynamic-text-based-on-user-select:** Loads text fields based on the selection made for a user field
